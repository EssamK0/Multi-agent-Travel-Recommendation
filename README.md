# Multi-agent-Travel-Recommendation
Multi agent Travel Recommendation using Autogen

## About: 
This project adopts Autogen multi-agents, comprising 5 assistant agents alongside 1 user proxy agent. What 
sets our project apart is the deliberate choice not to utilize GPT. Instead, we employ open-source LLMs such 
as Llama and Zephyr, leveraging LM Studio to run these models locally. Our approach aligns with a Trip 
Advisor use case, assigning specific roles—such as Flights, Hotels, Attractions, and more—to each assistant, 
thereby ensuring specialized functionalities within the system.

## Requirement Specification:
Python Version: We are utilizing Python version 3.10 (64-bit)  
Pip install’s:  
!pip install pyautogen 
LM Studio : LM Studio is an easy to use desktop app for experimenting with local and open-source Large 
Language Models (LLMs). -
